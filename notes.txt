Prerequisites:
    Go tools (https://go.dev/dl)
    Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com)

Why Go?
    1. Close to hardware
         compilation to native code
         No portability (like Java)

    2. Simplicity
        Only 25 keywords
            - No access modifiers (public / projected / private)
            - No classes (only structs)
            - No inheritence (only compostion)
            - No execeptions (only errors)
            - No "try catch error"
            - No reference type (everything is a value)
            - No pointer arithmetic
            - No implicity type conversion

        package, import, func, var, if else, switch case, for, break, continue, go, type, struct, interface, chan, select case, range

    3. Concurrency Support
        Features in the Language
            go, range, select case, chan (data type), <- (channel operator)
        sync package
        sync/atomic package

To run a go program
    go run <program.go>

To create a build
    go build <program.go>

To customize the build name
    go build -o <binary_name> <program.go>

To list all the go environment variables
    go env

To get the value of environment variables
    go env <env_var_1> <env_var_2>

To create a build for a different platform (cross compilation)
    GOOS=<target_os> GOARCH=<target_arch> go build <program.go>

To change the environment variables
    go env -w GOOS=windows GOARCH=386


Data Types
    bool
    string

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 (real [float32] imaginary [float32])
    complex128 (real [float64] imaginary [float64])

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for int32 ) (unicode code point)

Functions
    - variadic functions
    - anonymous functions
    - higher order functions (functions are first class objects)
        * functions can be assigned values to variables
        * functions can be passed as arguments
        * functions can be returned as return values

Collections
    - Array
        fixed size collection of data of the same type

    - Slice
        Varying size collection of data of the same type
        3 word object with a pointer to an array
        
    - Map
        collection of key/value pairs

Modularity
    Before Go 1.13
        No modules
        The application code should be in a predefined folder 
        $GOPATH
            /pkg => code for 3rd party packages will be downloaded
            /bin => 3rd party binaries will be downloaded
            /src => your application code
                /github.com
                    /tkmagesh
                        /my-app
                            import "github.com/tkmagesh/pkg-1"
                        /pkg-1
                        /pkg-2

    Modules were introduced in Go 1.13
        go.mod
            module name (advisable => repository path of the module ex: github.com/tkmagesh/my-app)
            minimum go version

        To create a module
            go mod init <module_name>

        To run a module
            go run .

        To create a build
            go build .

        To download a 3rd party package
            go get <module_name>

        To sync go.mod file with the usage of other modules in the app
            go mod tidy

        To localize the code of all the dependencies 
            go mod vendor

        To download the dependencies (based on go.mod file)
            go mod download

        To install a go executable
            go install <module>

        go mod graph
        go mod why

concurrency:
    IMPORTANT:
        NEVER assume the time taken for a goroutine to complete
        NEVER assume the sequence of execution of goroutines

    Channel
        var ch chan int
        ch = make(chan int)

        Send operation
            ch <- data
        Receive operation
            fmt.Println(<- ch)


        Behavior
            A RECEIVE operation is ALWAYS a blocking operation
            A SEND operation is blocked until a RECEIVE operation is initiated (conditions apply)
                In other words, a SEND operation cannot succeed until a RECEIVE operation is initiated
