Prerequisites:
    Go tools (https://go.dev/dl)
    Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com)

Why Go?
    1. Close to hardware
         compilation to native code
         No portability (like Java)

    2. Simplicity
        Only 25 keywords
            - No access modifiers (public / projected / private)
            - No classes (only structs)
            - No inheritence (only compostion)
            - No execeptions (only errors)
            - No "try catch error"
            - No reference type (everything is a value)
            - No pointer arithmetic
            - No implicity type conversion

        package, import, func, var, if else, switch case, for, break, continue, go, type, struct, interface, chan, select case, range

    3. Concurrency Support
        Features in the Language
            go, range, select case, chan (data type), <- (channel operator)
        sync package
        sync/atomic package
